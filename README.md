# real-time-bus-tracker

This exercise uses a map API to show a map at any given cooridinates. The excerise used the API of the MBTA bus to track down the bus location and we mapped out the specific cooridinates of the bus spots between MIT and Harvard. This upload tracks the shuttle bus from Bentley University to Harvard Square.


You can run this program through VS code and opening the .HTML file in your browser.

Hopes for improvement, continue to work with the Bentley API to have it refresh using a callback function
